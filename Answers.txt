1 .Accuracy improves.

2. Increasing the number of hidden nodes from 2 to 3 resulted in a significant boost in accuracy. The highest accuracy was achieved with 5 hidden nodes. However, adding more than 5 hidden nodes caused a slight drop in accuracy, indicating that too many hidden nodes can negatively affect performance.
